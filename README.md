# Data Structures Coursework for CM2303

This coursework looked at performing actions on a generated 2D matrix. This application converts a 2D matrix to a 1D sparse matrix (storing the value and position of the values).

It has methods which can effectively display the matrix in both 1D and 2D representations to the user, and also has a function which can transpose the matrix in O(n).

This coursework was delivered in May 2013 and received full marks.
